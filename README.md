# NadVibS
Nonadiabatic vibrational spectrum simulation package

Originate from NADVIBS.X by Michael Schuurman 2007

nadvibs.in will be automatically generated by SurfGenBound (and is well documented). However, user have to take care of the FORTRAN namelist file basis.in:
* restart   = 0, new job; else, restart
* ordr      = order of the expansion for diabatic hamiltonian
* natoms    = number of atoms in molecule
* nmodes    = number of vibrational modes
* nstates   = number of electronic states
* nirreps   = number of irreducible representations in point group symmetry
* npirr     = number of normal modes in each irreducible representation
* basis     = number of basis functions for each vibrational mode
* initstate = the initial vibrational state of the precursor (specified by the quanta of each precursor normal mode)
* shiftref  = 0, do not use new origin; else, use new origin
* niter     = number of lanczos iterations to be performed
* bconv     = (default 1) -lg( convergence tolerence for eigen value )
* idroot    = (default 0) how many of the lead contributors to a vibronic level to identify
* soroot    = number of roots to compute spin orbit parameters
* chkorthog = (default 100) every how many iterations compute exact dot products if using recurrence
* nseg      = (default 1) number of segements to divide lanczos vector into
* ztoler    = (default 1d-20) Any coefficient less ztoler is set to 0
* maxdisk   = (default 1000) maximum amount of disk available for use (in MB)
* weights   = (default 0) initial weights of the electronic states
